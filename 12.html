<h3>COLLEGE COMMITMENT</h3>
<p>You will continue to receive decision letters from colleges–check your email daily!</p>
<p>Do NOT commit to a college until you receive decision letters and financial aid packages from EVERY college you applied to – be sure the college you choose is the right fit for you: academically, financially, socially, geographically etc. </p>
<p>For each acceptance letter you receive, you will receive instructions on how to commit to that college.</p>
<p>Once you choose the best college for you, you will COMMIT to that college and send in your commitment deposit to hold your spot for the fall semester.</p>
<p style="text-decoration:underline">THIS PROCESS MUST BE COMPLETED BY APRIL 20TH TO ENSURE YOUR COMMITMENT IS RECEIVED BEFORE MAY 1st. IF YOU MISS THIS DEADLINE, YOUR SEAT WILL BE GIVEN AWAY TO ANOTHER STUDENT.</p>

<h4>ATTENDING A CUNY COLLEGE?</h4>
<p>1. Claim your CUNYFIRST account (follow instructions from CUNY email)
<p>2. Go to the STUDENT CENTER of your CUNYFIRST page
<p>3. "Accept” your offer to the school you are attending in the fall
<p>4. Check if you are required to pay the commitment deposit (it will say “waived” if you are not required)
<p>5. Check your “TO DO” list – complete ALL REQUIRED STEPS
<p>6. Take your placement exam on the scheduled date/time/location they assign to you via email!
<p>7. Accept your financial aid award on your CUNYFIRST account
<p>8. Check your email daily for next steps from the college

<h4>ACCEPTANCE AND SCHOLARSHIP AWARDS</h4>
<p style="text-align: center"><b>Print a copy of your acceptance letters and scholarship award letters and bring to the college office.</b></p>

<h4>AFTER YOU COMMIT TO A COLLEGE</h4>
<p>1. log into your TAP account www.hesc.ny.gov
<p>2. click Student Access
<p>3. click Change TAP College Code/Address
<p>4. change the name of the college to the one you committed to- make sure the name is next to the Fall and Spring semester (if the college you are attending is already listed correctly, you do not have to do anything)
<p>Ø TAP $$ goes directly to the college’s financial aid office. This is a critical step to ensure your TAP $$ goes to the college you will be attending.

<h4>MAY 1ST-COLLEGE DECISION DAY</h4>
<p>We celebrate YOU on May 1st. There will be a celebration in the College Office on May 1st for all seniors who present a decision/commitment letter. You must print out proof of your college commitment. There will be raffles, snacks, give-a-ways, music, and a photo opt!</p>

<h4>FINAL TRANSCRIPTS</h4>
<p>If you are attending a college that you applied to using:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:900">COMMON APPLICATION:</span> You MUST give your name to your SLC guidance counselor and ask them to send your final transcript through the Common Application</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:900">SUNY.EDU:</span> Final transcript will automatically be sent to the SUNY you committed to (assuming you entered your OSIS # at the time you applied)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:900">CUNY.EDU:</span> Final transcript will automatically be sent to the CUNY you committed to</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:900">College Specific Website:</span> (Example: you applied to St. John’s using www.stjohns.edu) You MUST fill out pink form in the COLLEGE OFFICE and hand to Ms. Hofer in room 116L. This is the ONLY way a final transcript will be mailed once you graduate</p>
