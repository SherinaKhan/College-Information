<h2>Advice for 11th Graders</h2>
<p><b>This year is plays a vital role in the college process!</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:900">College Fair and Financial Aid Night:</span> Attend both events!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:900">Parent Tax Return:</span> If you are a US Citizen or Permanent Resident, be sure your parent files a tax return. You will need this yearâ€™s tax return when applying for FAFSA (financial aid) next year as a senior.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:900">SAT/ACT:</span>PREPARE for standardized tests- these tests can earn you $FREE scholarship money$ toward college when you start applying next year and can place you OUT of remedial college courses- one FREE SAT is given to all juniors in March (you will be automatically registered).
Qualifying students can get 2 Free SAT fee waivers and 2 free ACT fee waivers </p>
<p style="text-indent:40px"><span style="font-weight:900">Qualifications:</span>Sign up to re-take another SAT after March if you want to get into a college with higher requirements.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:900">College Campus Visits:</span> Campus tours run daily. Create a college list based on your GPA and March SAT score  and visit them.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:900">Attendance:</span> It is crucial to attend class. You need the required amount of credits in order to graduate. Credits can only be acquired by passing your classes. In order to pass you need to show up to class! Your GPA at the end of junior year is what colleges use for admission.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:900">Regents:</span> These exams play a vital role in the graduation process and college admission. You need 5 passed regents to graduate. However, to prevent wasting your time and money on remedial classes in college, make sure you are college ready. 
<br>75 ELA & 80 Math Regents = College Ready</br></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:900">Extracurricular Activities:</span> Participate in clubs, sports, College Bound organizations, volunteer work, employment, etc. Colleges want to see involvement, diversity and commitment. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight:900">AP Courses:</span> Start or continue taking AP classes. Learn college level curriculum. Based on your AP exam score, you could gain FREE college credits.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:900">College Now:</span> Consider taking College Now courses next year. You could earn FREE college credits. There is not any standardized exam for majority of these classes and you can receive a college ID with many benefits.</p>
